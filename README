NAME
    Types::DBI - type constraints for dealing with relational databases

SYNOPSIS
       package FroobleBase;
   
       use Moose;
       use Types::DBI;
   
       has dbh => (
          is       => 'ro',
          isa      => Dbh['PostgreSQL'],
          coerce   => 1,
          required => 1,
       );

DESCRIPTION
    Types::DBI is a type constraint library suitable for use with Moo/Moose
    attributes, Kavorka sub signatures, and so forth.

  Types
    This module provides two type constraints, but only `Dbh` is exported by
    default.

    `Dbh`
        A class type for DBI database handles (DBI::db objects). Coercions
        from:

        from `Str`
            The string will be passed to `DBI->connect` as the DSN. Empty
            strings will be supplied as the username and password parameters.
            (Many databases allow the username and password to be specified as
            part of the DSN. Some databases like SQLite can be usefully used
            without any authentication details.) The `RaiseError` attribute
            will be set to true.

        from `ArrayRef`
            The arrayref will be dereferenced and passed to `DBI->connect`.

    `Dbh[`a]`
        `Dbh` can be parameterized with one or more database names:

           isa  => Dbh["SQLite"]

           isa  => Dbh[qw/ SQLite PostgreSQL /]

        The database names must be a case-sensitive match for the strings
        returned by `$dbh->get_info(SQL_DBMS_NAME)`.

        Coercions are inherited from non-parameterized `Dbh`.

    `Sth`
        A class type for DBI statement handles (DBI::st objects). No
        coercions.
